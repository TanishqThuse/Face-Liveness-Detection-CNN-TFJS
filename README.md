# Face-Liveness-Detection-CNN-TFJS
This project implements face liveness detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to distinguish between real and spoofed faces. It supports active liveness detection techniques and leverages TensorFlow.js for seamless browser-based authentication. The system enhances security for online identity verification and authentication platforms.
